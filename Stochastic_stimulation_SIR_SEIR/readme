2. Open error_bars.py and edit to change the parameter values
3. To change initial conditions open SIR_functions.py and edit it

6. Convert them to the Ro based on the formula suggested in the paper and plot them using excel or look into creating graphs code in paper/Figures_Tabels/

1. Change directory into SEIR_model/Error_bars_SEIR/
2. Change directory based on the initial condition you want 
3. Run error_bars.py
4. This will produce "values.csv"
