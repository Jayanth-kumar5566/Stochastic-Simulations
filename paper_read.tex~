\section{What I need to do?}
To create a SIR model of two cities with different $R_{0}$'s connected
by a transport and figure out the $R_{0}$ of the new connected system.

\begin{description}
\item[From readings of paper I, Day I] \hfill \ The calculations of
  individual city $R_{0}$ depends on the SIR model of the paticular
  city, ie, It does not account for the transportation term or the
  city is considered to be a closed system.
